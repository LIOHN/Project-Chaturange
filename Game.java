	* the overarching case is "you can't move if your king is  under attack".
	* My rationale is: every piece has its own isAllowedMove that decides whether it's okay 
	* for a piece to move (whether it can move in a certain direction, and if so, whether 
	* it can move to a certain position) Checking for a check on the king falls under the

	* is allowed. 
	*
	* isInCheck checks if a player's king is under attack by iterating 
	* through all pieces (iterating through each square of the board and getting piece on that 
	* square) and checking if that piece is an opponent's.
	* If it is, get its possble endSquare if it were to move, and if that piece is the Player
	* player's king, then return true as that is a check. This method is found in verifyMove();

	* on both kings.
